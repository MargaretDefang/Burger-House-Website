üçî Burger House Website

The Burger House Website is a modern and responsive web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to showcase a burger restaurant‚Äôs brand, menu, and services in an engaging and user-friendly way.

The homepage features a bold hero section with a call-to-action that immediately grabs visitors‚Äô attention. The menu section highlights a variety of burgers, complete with names, images, prices, and short descriptions. Customers can easily browse through options, explore combo meals, and discover the restaurant‚Äôs specialties.

A contact/order section is included for customers to get in touch or place inquiries, making the site not just a showcase but also a functional tool for customer engagement. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring smooth navigation on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Visually, the website combines a clean and modern design with appetizing food imagery to create a professional and inviting digital presence. Basic JavaScript interactivity adds features like menu filtering, navigation enhancements, or simple order/cart functionality (depending on implementation).

This project is ideal for showcasing my front-end development skills while also serving as a template for restaurants and food businesses looking to establish an online presence.
